DBD::Chart 0.50 is now available from either 
http://www.presicient.com/dbdchart/ or from CPAN (shortly).

Changes from 0.43:
	- added 3 axis bar charts
	- GD::Graph, GD::Graph3d no longer required (DBD::Chart::Plot includes
		its own barchart, piechart rendering engine)
	- added box & whisker charts
	- iconic barcharts and datapoints (ie, bars as stacks of icons, instead of
		solid rectangles)
	- generation of HTML or Perl imagemap files to create hotspots for data points
	- added GRIDCOLOR property to specify color of background grid
	- added TEXTCOLOR property to specify color of image text
	- several bug fixes
	- minimum Perl 5.6.0 required
	- moved log processing to the Plot module

FYI: DBD::Chart is a Perl DBI driver abstraction for rendering charts
and graphs using a variant of SQL. Review the DBD::Chart homepage at
http://www.presicient.com/dbdchart/ for detailed
information.

NOTES:

Current DBD::Chart users should re-run their scripts through
this version to be certain they're satisfied with any possible
changes, and to assure backward compatibility. While I have tried
to maintain backward compatibility, DBD::Chart::Plot's new 
barchart and piechart engine will produce visibly different 
output than the previous GD::Graph-based versions, and 
(alas) I haven't had time to implement the 3-D effect for 
piecharts yet.

For those directly using DBD::Chart::Plot (ie, using Perl attribute
hashes rather than SQL), you should read the included README.plot
for the updates. Again, I have tried to maintain backward compatibility,
but there may be something that got lost in the upgrade.

Feedback on problems, suggestions, even complaints, is welcome.
Just drop a note to darnold@presicient.com.

Regards,
Dean Arnold
